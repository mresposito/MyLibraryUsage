My Library Usage
==========
My first Django application. I develop this small app as I was learning python, django and sqlalchemy. 
It parses your iTunes library and stores into a database. Then, you can check the usage of your library, and some statistics.
You can also browse it.
*Note:* UI needs some serious love ;)
